									<h1>Azure Hybrid Network Design Scheme<br />
									</h1>
									<p>This project explores the hybrid network capabilities in Azure. It goes into an in-depth look at 
										on-premesis integration by developing a site-to-site VPN connection to Azure resources using a VPN gateway, 
										virtual network peering, and a VPN software appliance running on Hyper-V.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/hub-spoke.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>about Azure Virtual Networks</h2>
									<p>Azure virtual networks provide a specific set of tools and resources for building cloud-based network 
										architectures. They're composed of a variety of elements including, but not limited to, network interfaces,
										load balancers, subnets, network security groups, and public IP addresses. All these elments work in tangent
										to enable secure communication between the on-premesis network and Azure resources.</p>
								<h2>On-Premise requirements</h2>
									<p>There are several configurations you'll want to make on your on-premise environment (outlined below) to be able to
										establish a connection to the virtual network in your Azure resources.
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Port Forwarding:</strong> There are two key protocols that fall under the IPSec suite. IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange
												version 2) and ESP (Encapsulationg Security Payloads). Many network middleboxes by default block both of these protocols from traversing over TCP connections on your LAN. Forwarding ports 500 (IKE) and 4500 (IPSec NAT-T) will ensure
											incoming VPN connection negitations are able to successfully traverse your LAN. Checkout <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8229">RFC 8229</u></a> for a deep breakdown of TCP encapsulation of IKE and IPSec packets. </li>
											<li><strong>VPN Appliance:</strong> The VPN appliance used in this project was a Windows RRAS server sitting in Hyper-V configured with two virtual switches. The external virtual switch was used so the RRAS server could reach the default gateway 
												and have access to the internet. The internal virtual switch was used so the other virtual machines in the hypervisor could communicate with the RRAS server to keep the hypervisor network isolated.
												<li><strong>LAN Topology:</strong> Below is a very basic diagram of what my topology looks like. 
											</li>
										</ul>

								<h2>Azure requirements</h2>
									</p> In this section we'll talk about the configuration of the Azure resources resources used to setup the site-to-site connection with our 
									on-premise environment.<p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Subnets:</strong> We created two subnets in our virtaul network. The first subnet which is only used to
												virtaul network gateway resource. The second subnet is the management subnet where we deployed a Ubuntu server which acts as jumpbox to the other spoked virtual networks
											</li>
											<li><strong>Virtual Network Gateway:</strong> This is the software VPN device for our virtual network and is used with the connection
												resource to set up the site-to-site VPN connection. We also deployed a Public IP address which is associated with the virtual network gateway
											</li>
											<li><strong>Connection:</strong> This resource is where we create the pre-shared key which serves to authenticate peers to eachother during phase 1 IKE negotiations. The connection resources
											also helps establish the protocol type which in our case is IKEv2.</li>
											<li><strong>Peering:</strong> This resource was used to connect our spoke 1 and spoke 2 virtual networks to the hub virtual network. Once these virtual networks are succesfully peered, resources
												in all three networks are able to communicate with each other, as if the resources were in the same virtual network. </li>
										</ul>
								<h2>Final Notes</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>There is no way to turn off the Azure VPN resource once created. The cost is based on the amount of time the gateway is porvisioned and available </li>
									<li>The biggest advantage of using Azure networking is having that (in theory) unlimited bandwidth and connectivity. However, You still want data flow in and 
										out of Azure to be as lean as possible to keep cost down.</li>
									<li>Check out the link below for the detailed IP addressing scheme I used for the project</li>
